# GDLoader: Mod Loader for Geometry Dash!

**This project is currently W.I.P and is not ready for the end-user.**

## Purpose
This project aims to allow people to load their own mods in Geometry Dash without using DLL injection or external programs to write to the game's memory.

## Installing
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Bonkeyzz/GDLoader/releases) of the mod loader.
2. Extract it.
3. Open `GDPatcher.exe` and on the open dialog point it to the `GeometryDash.exe` executable.
4. After it says that the patch is done, copy the `Mods` folder and `GDLoader.dll` into the Geometry dash install directory. (You can also create your own Mods folder.)


## Creating Mods
An example addon is in this repo, currently only one function is implemented but more are coming in the future.
